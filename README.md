# PIPEnspect
PIPEnspect is a automation tool which uses computer vision, precisely _Convolution Neural Netwroks_, to perform visual analysis on pipelines. It is capable of detection major on-shore and subsea anomalies such as: corrosion, gouges, cracks, dents, and coating loss. The frontend of the application is built with _streamlit_.

In order to run this project, please create a virtual environment and intall the packages from the `requiremnts.txt` file using `pip instal -r requirements.txt`. Apart from that, the base machine must be equipped with atleast  `FFmpeg == 5.1.x` through the _Chocolatey_ software on your local `shell`.
